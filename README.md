To install the project follow this tutorial.

## MongoDB

* This project was built using [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/). You have to install MongoDB on your machine to be able to run the project.

## Backend

* The backend of this project is built using Java **Spring**. You need a **Java IDE** and **Maven** to run the project.
  * I recommend [IntelliJ IDEA Community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), because it is a free friendly IDE.
* Once you have your IDE ready, open **api** folder as a project and use the following command to start the backend (`mvn spring-boot:run`).

* For the frontend of this project you need **Angular**.
  * First, you have to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
  * After you installed **NodeJS** you can navigate to **frontend/src/app** folder and open a command prompt to run the command `ng serve`. This command will start the frontend.
    *  You can also download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), a modern text editor that supports hudrends of plugins to make your life easier.

Now you are all set and the project should run as intended.
